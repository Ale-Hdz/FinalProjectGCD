* 
* Modifications made in the column names:
	- Replaced t by time
	- Replace f by freq
	- Replace mad by median
	- Replace Acc by Acceleration

* Create a second data set which incorporates the information the subject who did the specified activity,
  this information is originally stored in "subject_train.txt" file. This new data frame is grouped into
  activity and subject. Finally it is calculated the mean of each variable-activity-subject combination
  and the result is stored in "05-group_avg.txt" file.
